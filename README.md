Espruino Apps
=============

Open source software applications for [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) devices such as Puck.js, Bangle.js and Jolt.js.


Programming Espruino Devices
----------------------------

Devices can be programmed via the [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/), which uses Web Bluetooth.  Simply open in the IDE the file from the corresponding device's folder in this repository and program the device.  Consult our tutorials for step-by-step instructions:
- [Puck.js Development Guide](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/puckjs-dev/)
- [Bangle.js Development Guide](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/banglejs-dev/)
- [Jolt.js Development Guide](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/joltjs-dev/)


App Descriptions
----------------

### Emojuino (emojuino.js)

Program the Bangle.js v2 or BBC micro:bit v2 to allow the user to select and transmit an emoji (or any Unicode character) via Bluetooth Low Energy as an [InteroperaBLE Identifier](https://reelyactive.github.io/interoperable-identifier/).  Available via the [Bangle.js app loader](https://banglejs.com/apps/#emojuino), where the latest version is maintained.

### Knob.js (knob-button.js)

Program the Puck.js v2 to advertise its angle of rotation, like a knob, following a button press.  Works best in the vertical plane (as it uses accelerometer data, rotation angle estimation is not possible in the horizontal plane).  [Load in Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/?codeurl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reelyactive/espruino-apps/master/puckjs-v2/knob-button.js)

### 12-Year Anniversary Clock

Program the Jolt.js as a physical clock with hour and minute hands, controlled by stepper motors.  [Load in Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/?codeurl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reelyactive/espruino-apps/master/joltjs/anniversary-clock.js)

### Egg Hunt (egghunt.js)

Program the Bangle.js to hunt for BLE "eggs" which grow in size the closer they get.  The Puck.js can be programmed to act as an Espruino "egg" which can be switched on/off with a button press.  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUIwdN5F4yI)

### Contact Tracing (contacttracing.js)

Program the Puck.js to simulate the Contact Tracing service collaboration between Apple and Google ([see specifications](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/)) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Puck.js will transmit a rolling proximity identifier which changes (randomly) every 15 minutes, and can be switched on/off with a button press.  The Bangle.js can be programmed to detect Contact Tracing service transmissions and to vibrate relative to their proximity.
